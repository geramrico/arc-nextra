## Errors

Understanding error codes is crucial for effective troubleshooting. The Arcus API uses both HTTP status error codes and custom Arcus API error codes to indicate the nature of an issue.

### HTTP Error Codes

**For Banking Correspondents**

If you are a banking correspondent, it is mandatory to comply with CNBV regulations. Specifically, you must implement error codes **R126** and **R127** in your system.

Whenever you get these errors, you must print the text in the _"message"_ field in a receipt and hand it to the final user.
