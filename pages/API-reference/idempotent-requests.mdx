# Idempotent Requests
## Overview

Idempotency ensures that multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. In the Arcus API, various HTTP methods exhibit different idempotent behaviors:

* Safe Methods: GET is considered a safe method, designed solely for data retrieval. It is inherently idempotent.

* Idempotent Methods: PUT and DELETE are idempotent by definition, meaning repeated calls yield the same result.

* Non-Idempotent Method: POST is generally not idempotent, as it is often used to create new resources. Multiple identical POST requests typically result in multiple new resources.

## Special Handling of POST Requests
Arcus API extends idempotency to POST requests, allowing you to safely retry a failed or timed-out request without the risk of unintended duplication. For instance, if a payment API call times out, you can resend the same request with the assurance that the payment will only be processed once.

## Implementation
To enable idempotency for POST requests in Arcus API V3.mx, include an additional header named `Idempotency-Key` in your request.

## Rules for Idempotency-Key
* Maximum Length: The idempotency key can be up to 36 digits long.

* Minimum Length: The idempotency key must be at least 12 digits long.

* Recommended Format: We recommend using a Version 4 UUID as the idempotency key.

* Expiration: The idempotency key will expire 24 hours after its creation.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can leverage idempotency to make your API interactions more robust and reliable.
