## Transaction Receipts

As a banking correspondent, you are required by regulation to print and hand to the final user a transaction receipt for the following:

- Successful transaction: Either por payements, deposits or withdrawals.
- Exceeding transaction limits: Getting an HTTP 422 Status code with the error code R126 y R127.

### Succesful Transaction

You can consider a transaction successful when you get an HTTP 200 response along with a transaction object.

Whenever that happens, you must print a receipt that contains the following information:

- [ ] Transaction Timestamp: Date and time
- [ ] The transaction reference is masked. For example: the acount 123456789 is shown as `*****6789`
- [ ] It includes the legend, depending on the case:
  - Deposit: `"Depósito en efectivo a cuenta de débito [Financial Institution Commercial Name]"`
  - Payment: `"Pago en efectivo de tarjeta de crédito [Financial Institution Commercial Name]"`
  - Withdrawal: `"Retiro de efectivo de cuenta [Financial Institution Commercial Name]"`
- [ ] Identifies the Banking Correspondent: Your own legal name
- [ ] Includes the text: `"La operación se hace por cuenta y orden de [Financial Institution Legal Name]"`
- [ ] Transaction PoS Address
- [ ] Cashier ID: Employee ID or name
- [ ] Customer Support Info:
  -      Provided in the field "`ticket_text`" from the API response

### Exceeding Transaction Amount limits

Arcus will respond with error R126 and R127, as well as a message associated with each error code when a user tries to make a transaction that exceeds the operation limits allowed by the CNBV:

- Deposit and Payments: 4000 UDI / day / account
- Withdrawal: 1500 UDI / day / account

You do not need to validate this rule on your end. Arcus will send the fitting error message when applicable. However, you must print on the receipt:

**Error R126**: Print value from the "message" field in the receipt.

**Error R127**: Print value from the "message" field in the receipt.
