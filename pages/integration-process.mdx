<Steps>
### Alignment and kick off

Begin with an initial meeting between your team and Arcus's integration specialists. This meeting will set the stage for the integration, outlining the scope, timelines, and responsibilities.
### Get sandbox access

After the kick-off, you'll receive credentials to access Arcus's sandbox environment. This is a safe space where you can experiment with the API without affecting live data.
### Start testing the API

Use the sandbox environment to start making API calls. Familiarize yourself with the request and response formats, and test different types of transactions to ensure they meet your business requirements.

Get a head start using our postman collection:

### Create a mock conciliation file

Generate a mock [conciliation file](/guides/conciliation-file) based on the transactions you've tested in the sandbox. This will help you understand the file structure and prepare you for the real conciliation process.
<Callout type='warning'>
If you are integrating as a Banking Correspondent (operating with regulated financial entities) you should also [cipher](/guides/conciliation-cipher-process) the conciliation file.
</Callout>

### Get certified

Once you're comfortable with the API and the mock conciliation file, you'll go through a certification process. This involves a series of tests to ensure that your implementation meets Arcus's standards for security and functionality.

### Get access to our production environment

After successful certification, you'll receive credentials to access Arcus's production environment. At this point, you can start processing real transactions and will be fully integrated with Arcus's services.

To get production access you need to:
- [ ] Pass certification tests
- [ ] Complete the [Pre-Production Questionnaire](/resources/production-info)
- [ ] Have a signed contract
